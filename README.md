# Signal finder

## Purpose of this project

It was originally given as a 'job-test' exercise when I was applying for a job. 

Also it was good excuse for me personally to learn more about:
* Python 
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Anaconda
* Math: vector math, probability, DSP

Also I kind of like generating pretty charts.

## What it does

It's time domain search of a specific signal and counting such signals. 
It serves no greater good, it was just an personal summer exercise. It's also inefficient & unoptimized.

## Should you look at it?

Only if you want to know if I can write Python. Otherwise, no.

## Pretty charts

Finding sample in clean version of signal

Finding sample in synthetic version of signal (made out of samples)

Finding sample in synthetic version of signal, but with 33% of Gaussian noise applied

Processing steps on clean signal.
First chart ORIG is sample.
Second chart SIG is original signal.
Other charts are processing steps.
